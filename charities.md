## [World Toilet Organization](http://worldtoilet.org)

Worldwide, 2.4 billion people lack access to proper sanitation. Just like food, water, and air, clean and safe toilets are necessary for health and dignity. Diarrhoeal diseases – a direct consequence of poor sanitation – kill more children every year than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.

[The World Toilet Organization](https://worldtoilet.org/) strongly believes that to address the global sanitation crisis, collective action is necessary. Through the [Toilet College](http://worldtoilet.org/what-we-do/world-toilet-college/), the WTO educates and trains entrepreneurs on proper sanitation. In 2016, the WTO partnered with *Wetlands Work!* to bring the [HandyPod](http://worldtoilet.org/cambodias-floating-villages/) to Cambodia's floating community of Tonle Sap. This incredible proactive project helps entire populations to remain healthy.

Through coordination with governments and social organizations across many countries, 'Mr. Toilet' has forged partnerships to better bring proper sanitation to many platforms. The WTO even works with the UN for global sanitation goals and World Toilet Day, November 19, which highlights and focuses the need for sanitation.
