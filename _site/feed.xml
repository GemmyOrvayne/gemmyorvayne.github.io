&lt;p&gt;Another hidden shitter in Skyrim! This starts out as a sword, named Red Eagle’s Fury, which can be inserted into a stone plinth at Rebel’s Cairn to trigger a trap door in the cave. If you complete the quest, and kill the draugr Red Eagle, you’d remove the sword to reveal its name has changed to Red Eagle’s Bane. Or, you could set it on fire, and turn it into a bucket, like I have demonstrated here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="skyrim" /><category term="shitter" /><summary type="html">Rebel’s Cairn shitter!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cellulose Nitrate Dice</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/interesting/ponderous/2018/12/19/Cellulose-Dice.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cellulose Nitrate Dice" /><published>2018-12-19T21:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-19T21:10:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/interesting/ponderous/2018/12/19/Cellulose-Dice</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/interesting/ponderous/2018/12/19/Cellulose-Dice.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;cellulose-nitrate-was-used-to-make-dice-from-the-late-1860s-until-the-middle-of-the-twentieth-century-and-the-material-remains-stable-for-decades-then-in-a-flash-they-can-dramatically-decompose-nitric-acid-is-released-in-a-process-called-outgassing-the-dice-cleave-crumble-and-then-implode&quot;&gt;Cellulose nitrate was used to make dice from the late 1860s until the middle of the twentieth century, and the material remains stable for decades.

&lt;p&gt;Wow, were Quentin Tarantino and Guillermo del Toro both here having gay horror sex? These photos, which will surely be admitted into evidence, feature Room 1K as last visited by the Pintsized Slasher (see terrifying mask, photo 2). The third photo is the shitter in the motel office, as taken from &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the women’s room, from which vantage point one has full view of the urinal. That’s the quality contracting and craftsmanship you can count on from the inbred mutant swamp that is Point Lookout!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout" /><category term="fallout 3" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Homestead Motel shitters!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Herzog Mine Shitters</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/19/Herzog-Mine.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Herzog Mine Shitters" /><published>2018-12-19T20:55:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-19T20:55:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/19/Herzog-Mine</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/19/Herzog-Mine.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;miners-rest-at-herzog-mine-point-lookout-shitters&quot;&gt;Miner’s Rest at Herzog Mine, Point Lookout shitters!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenny has sweet digs in the abandoned Herzog Mine and his guest bunk has its own shitter! Tons of toys and games will keep you from thinking about that skeleton of Old Man Herzog hanging from a noose in the hallway below. Yes, Kenny is absolutely playing checkers with a Garden Gnome. Kenny IS the Pint-Sized Slasher and I’m pretty sure that Gnome is living vicariously through Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the adjoining zone called Blackdamp Shaft, you can find the unique plushie named Kenny-bear. Do NOT return him to Kenny unless you FIRST remove the psycho Gnome! How do you think Kenny-bear got down there to begin with? Just take Kenny-bear with you, and leave the Pint-Sized Slasher and the Gnome to their games. Kenny-bear should see the wide frontier of the Capitol Wasteland from the zipper-hole of your backpack, not be left the doom of dissolving in a puddle of nuclear goo dripping from a cracked pipe in the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout" /><category term="fallout 3" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="are you afraid of the gnome" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Miner’s Rest at Herzog Mine, Point Lookout shitters!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Marguerite’s Shack Shitters</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/19/Marguerites-Shack.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Marguerite's Shack Shitters" /><published>2018-12-19T20:50:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-19T20:50:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/19/Marguerites-Shack</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/19/Marguerites-Shack.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;marguerites-shack-shitters&quot;&gt;Marguerite’s Shack shitters!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here’s a real chin-scratcher. There are plenty of objects here that look the part, but which is the legitimate shitter? I’m pretty sure one is a planter. The structural outhouse has a great deal of overgrowth and other indications of disuse (such as the ‘innocent’ gnome laying nearby who we all know is a vicious killer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I am putting my money on the only shitter here Marguerite is gonna be sharing private moments with as being the lovely powder room the third photo. I’m sure that sink whiskey is mostly for mouthwash. So, is this Where Marguerite nurses herself back to life every morning she has a hangover?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What say you, Marguerite?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t seem to really be up for talking just now. Anyway, ‘round back as you’re heading out, there’s a bathtub full of empty whiskey bottles. I’m sure this moonshiner would say they’re being saved for art projects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout" /><category term="fallout 3" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="are you afraid of the gnome" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Marguerite’s Shack shitters!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Teddy No</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/19/Teddy-No.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Teddy No" /><published>2018-12-19T20:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-19T20:45:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/19/Teddy-No</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/19/Teddy-No.html">&lt;p&gt;LOOK AT THIS.
