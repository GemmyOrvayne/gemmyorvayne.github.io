&lt;p&gt;The following shitters were submitted by Bucket Brigadier &lt;strong&gt;imsopopfly&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunken Skull Barrow:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I had begun to fear that you would find no more shitters in Skyrim, when I got a bright idea. Why not explore modded content? I have been exploring Falskaar of late in search of shitters to show you. This search has not been fruitless. Behold the first of the shitters I have found. This one is located in Sunken Skull Barrow. Simple, but functional! Also warm, just look how close it is to that nice fire. There’s even reading material! The local necromancers are lucky to have a shitter like this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulkrund Keep:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is Falskaar correspondent imsopopfly reporting live from Volkrund Keep, where I have found a DOUBLE SHITTER. No illusions of privacy here, folks. May offend the sensibilities of the more squeamish among us. Then again, you can’t exactly expect sensibility when the place is run by some crazy necromancer trying to reshape the world with the power of the Daedric lord Vaermina.  Honestly this double shitter is the least trippy thing in the entire keep, and a fine place to do your business when you consider the alternative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoneridge Watch:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The next shitter from Stoneridge Watch is rather bare-bones, but you can’t honestly expect more in a cell. The folks the bandits here keep prisoner should probably just count themselves lucky that they don’t have to use the floor instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are gems! Thank you, friend! I’m particularly fond of prison shitters. It’s like your only companion sometimes in a jail cell. That bucket is Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="skyrim" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="bucket brigade" /><summary type="html">Falskaar shitters!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mauhulakh Longhouse Shitters</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/17/Mauhulakh-Longhouse.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mauhulakh Longhouse Shitters" /><published>2018-12-17T22:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-17T22:15:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/17/Mauhulakh-Longhouse</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/17/Mauhulakh-Longhouse.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;mauhulakh-longhouse-shitters&quot;&gt;Mauhulakh Longhouse shitters!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Septimus Signus, whacky devotee of Hermaeus Mora, lives in a frozen berth just north of the College of Winterhold. Here he has minimal creature comforts, such as an enormous Dwemer puzzle cube, to keep him company. As an old codger, Septimus isn’t going outside to poop in the snow. It’s a constant blizzard out there! So he has this bucket. I believe it’s upside-down as a tribute to how cwazy Septimus has gotten over the decades. I imagine him putting the ewer on top and saying, “Lovely!” Anyway I’d probably store it upside-down too. In that miniature cavern, it may help stifle the stink.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="skyrim" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Septimus Signus’ Outpost shitter!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dear Diary</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/17/Dear-Diary.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dear Diary" /><published>2018-12-17T22:05:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-17T22:05:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/17/Dear-Diary</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/17/Dear-Diary.html"></content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout" /><category term="fallout 76" /><category term="things that happened today" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Glassed Cavern</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/17/Glassed-Cavern.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Glassed Cavern" /><published>2018-12-17T22:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-17T22:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/17/Glassed-Cavern</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/17/Glassed-Cavern.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;glassed-cavern-shitter&quot;&gt;Glassed Cavern shitter!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While gnomes are out causing mischief, teddy is here solving problems. This plucky bear is plunging with the arm of the skeleton from the potty next door. Not that the performance of this task would actually do anything to the functioning capability of the shitter, but he’s trying, and therefore no one should criticize him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout" /><category term="fallout 76" /><category term="shitter" /><summary type="html">Glassed Cavern shitter!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fort Defiance</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/gnomes/screenshot/2018/12/17/Fort-Defiance.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fort Defiance" /><published>2018-12-17T21:55:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-17T21:55:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/gnomes/screenshot/2018/12/17/Fort-Defiance</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/gnomes/screenshot/2018/12/17/Fort-Defiance.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fort Defiance&lt;/strong&gt; was an “insane asylum” (terminology not used for many a moon now) which was repurposed into a HQ for the defunct Brotherhood of Steel.

&lt;p&gt;I also located a curious chem lab, replete with crushed acetone containers, rat poison, and gasoline. Meth kitchen, or leatherworking workshop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At long last, I rounded the very top and saw this freak smirking at me from the edge of a precipice. I yeeted him off the brink without hesitation, and to my surprise, received 110 exp.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sunshine-tidings-co-op-shitters&quot;&gt;Sunshine Tidings Co-op shitters!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner of the coveted Brown Ribbon of the Year award in 2015 was this REALLY nice wooden outhouse at Sunshine Tidings Co-op. As you can see, this shitter is top-notch, with potential for a bright future. The elevated nature of this stall lends itself to superior protection against pests such as radroachs and molerats while you’re having a moment alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another notable shitter on the property that I have photographed and documented here, and which is a terrible sty. The metal shack features some splintery boards perched atop cinder blocks, and an accompanying rusted metal bucket. Creative, but a definite no-go. And are settlers expected to bathe here? My companion, Preston Garvey, obviously blurted out this non sequitur before he took a peek inside.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout" /><category term="fallout 4" /><category term="best in show" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Winner! of the prestigious 2015 Brown Ribbon!</summary></entry></feed>
