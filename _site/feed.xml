&lt;p&gt;You might think, on first glance, that being in the Enclave is a pretty sweet hookup. I mean, check out those bathrooms. Nice industrial design theme going on here. But then, you look closer and get the fright of your life from some Damaged Garden Gnomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stall door opens to reveal a Gnome wielding a deathclaw hand and pressing a damn flashlight to his face. Next, some dude left a nasty log in one bowl, and another guy prefers to use a bathroom for an office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last two pics you see a Teddy who is going to lose his fucking life if he doesn’t play the right moves, and below that is a Snidely Gnomelash that got blasted in the face by me before I ran away with his captives. Look at those picket signs! Those are from the Chryslus building!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout 3" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Enclave shitters!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Chryslus Building Shitter</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/Chryslus.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chryslus Building Shitter" /><published>2018-12-18T21:05:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-18T21:05:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/Chryslus</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/Chryslus.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;chryslus-building-shitter&quot;&gt;Chryslus Building shitter!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiptoe into this busted throneroom to take a piss while the Supermutants are preoccupied, and you’ll see a true mindfuck. That caution cone on the left of the room really needs to be in front of these two tricksters hiding in the stalls, holding signs that beg you to take them home. Do not pick up and cuddle a Shitter Gnome from Murdertown! Tell me this, Gnomes, if you’re so helpless on your own, how did you make those signs? I checked, but there really are no land mines or rigged shotguns or anything here. Since all Garden Gnomes carry a switchblade, don’t tell them where you live!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout 3" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Chryslus Building shitter!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Presidential Metro Train NPC</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/18/Presidential-Metro-Train.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Presidential Metro Train NPC" /><published>2018-12-18T21:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-18T21:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/18/Presidential-Metro-Train</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/18/Presidential-Metro-Train.html">&lt;p&gt;The Fallout 3 &lt;strong&gt;Presidential Metro Train&lt;/strong&gt; is actually a hat worn by an NPC hidden under the tracks who runs around at high speeds during the travel cut scene.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout 3" /><summary type="html">The Fallout 3 Presidential Metro Train is actually a hat worn by an NPC hidden under the tracks who runs around at high speeds during the travel cut scene.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tenpenny Tower</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/Tenpenny-Tower.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tenpenny Tower" /><published>2018-12-18T20:55:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-18T20:55:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/Tenpenny-Tower</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/Tenpenny-Tower.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;tenpenny-tower-shitters&quot;&gt;Tenpenny Tower shitters!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allistair Tenpenny is a milk drinker with the voice of Herbert the Pervert, and skid marks on the bottom of his bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also featured here is the Tenpenny Tower Men’s Room! This could well be the nicest public restroom in all of Washington DC in the year 2277. Electricity, working stall doors, urinals for tall and small, hand dryers, and that flooring. This is the way of life that we fight to protect daily on post-Government, post-Civilization, post-Hope Planet Earth. A posh locale where we may rest our haunches, and take a luxurious dump before succumbing to Radiation Sickness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout 3" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Tenpenny Tower shitters!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GNR Shitter</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/GNR.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GNR Shitter" /><published>2018-12-18T20:50:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-18T20:50:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/GNR</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/shitters/screenshot/2018/12/18/GNR.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;galaxy-news-radio-shitter&quot;&gt;Galaxy News Radio shitter!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gnomes would like to know the colors of the hats they are all wearing without checking their own. So instead of figuring out this logic puzzle, they went to the &lt;strong&gt;Red Rocket Megastop&lt;/strong&gt; and asked the Gnome Wizard, who said something like, &lt;em&gt;“We gnomes are evil, riddle-telling gremlins that forebode tragedy!

&lt;p&gt;It explains itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in case you wanted some lore on the subject, this is a two-story treehouse with many buildings spanning multiple trees. There are two doorless, bucketless, flooded port-a-potties standing erect in the swamp below, but you couldn’t use them, obviously, since the waters are teeming with anglers, giant glowing radtoads and various waterborne diseases. Thus, the durable janitor-green sentinel we see here. I like that they reinforced the back of it with boards. That’s totally not just a result of the designer half clipping the shitter into the wooden barricade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout 76" /><category term="shitter" /><category term="ROLLOVER" /><summary type="html">Treehouse Village shitters!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lago di Como Italy</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/totallylookslike/totally%20looks%20like/2018/12/18/LagodiComo.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lago di Como Italy" /><published>2018-12-18T20:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-18T20:20:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/totallylookslike/totally%20looks%20like/2018/12/18/LagodiComo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/totallylookslike/totally%20looks%20like/2018/12/18/LagodiComo.html"></content><author><name></name></author><category term="totally looks like" /><category term="totallylookslike" /><category term="oblivion" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
