&lt;p&gt;This crashed gondola car has been repurposed by these inventive [dead] raiders into a really fancy piss pot! They hauled it all the way up to this rock outcropping for a high-art, high-altitude shitter. This was well worth their trouble, even if they are all dead now and their camp is occupied by Super Mutants, because they left something their descendants could have been proud of. Stephen Hawking said that the only thing that lingers after your death is what you were able to contribute to the world, and &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; is Seneca Gang’s legacy!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout 76" /><category term="raider camps" /><summary type="html">Seneca Gang Camp Shitter!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">This helpful sign is found outside Top of the World</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/11/You-Can-Die.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="This helpful sign is found outside Top of the World" /><published>2018-12-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/11/You-Can-Die</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/screenshots/funny/screenshot/2018/12/11/You-Can-Die.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-can-die&quot;&gt;You Can Die&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helpful sign is found outside Top of the World. Fun Fact: Since radscorpions and rocket-launching Mole Men live there, you don’t even have to leave. You can die right at the Ski Resort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="screenshot" /><category term="fallout 76" /><category term="top of the world" /><summary type="html">You Can Die</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Gaming Thrones has a New Domain</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/text/updates/text%20conversation/2018/12/08/We-migrated-away-from-Tumblr.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Gaming Thrones has a New Domain" /><published>2018-12-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/text/updates/text%20conversation/2018/12/08/We-migrated-away-from-Tumblr</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/text/updates/text%20conversation/2018/12/08/We-migrated-away-from-Tumblr.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;weve-migrated-away-from-tumblr&quot;&gt;We’ve Migrated Away from Tumblr!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of Tumblr’s codebase being limiting or difficult to work with, and their recent changes to their definition of censorship, has prompted this change. I think this will be a good change! We were getting too comfortable on Tumblr, anyway. “Fat as a buttered bishop,” as Osferth of Wessex would say. So now we have a new layout and banner, and some new features coming soon. Enjoy!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="text conversation" /><category term="updates" /><category term="tumblr" /><summary type="html">We’ve Migrated Away from Tumblr!</summary></entry></feed>
