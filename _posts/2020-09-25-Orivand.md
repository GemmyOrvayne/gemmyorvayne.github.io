## High Judge Orivand's shitter!

Full disclosure: I had actually taken a pic of this one myself, but my screenshot totally sucked so I found this excellent version on the guides website (referenced below). Admittedly, the guide was trying to highlight the *quest item on the table* there but you and I both know that we are here for the antiquated crap bucket. 

High Judge Orivand shits in all his high-falutin glory in this friggin place - a crumbling fortress decked out in iron bars and coarse, red hempen banners. He has a very fancy bath, where he likes to scrubadub all under his judgmental fingernails and between his inquisitorial toes. That bucket next to the washtub? We all know what that is. The servant who brings the water isn't leaving the water bucket there and there's no water in this scene anyway so don't even start with me. What you are looking at is the genuine article: A shit bucket from the Dark Ages!
