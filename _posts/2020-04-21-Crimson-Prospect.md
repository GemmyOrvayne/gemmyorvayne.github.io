## Crimson Prospect shitter!

In the future, when there's no more society, nor indoor heat, and everything sucks, you're gonna want to set up your junkyard commune in a way that really feels like home. The assholes at Crimson Prospect boast a certain Raider ingenuity with the variety of their shitters. They've got the traditional green sentinal, but it's juxtaposed against an open-roof cousin with a concrete and repurposed wood palette surround. There's something to be said about the exposed, vulnerable charm of this outhouse. It looks great, and I imagine it feels great too: Whether you're watching cloud formations in the blistering heat of ambient irradiated fog, or getting pelted by irradiated rain, or contemplating nature while being attacked by mutated, irradiated flying insects.
