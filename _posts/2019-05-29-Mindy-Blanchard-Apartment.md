## Mindy Blanchard's Apartment shitter!

Mindy is a tattoo artist, originally from Morley, who graces Wanted posters throughout Karnaca. This is the shitter in Mindy's apartment! Note how she has changed out the traditional porcelain chamber pot with a fruit bowl. I love Mindy's overall gritty aesthetic. Improvisation is both a survival skill, and a design element in the era of the Bloodfly Plague!
