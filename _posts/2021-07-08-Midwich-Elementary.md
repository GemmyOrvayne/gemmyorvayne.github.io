## Midwich Elementary School shitter!

**Dead by Daylight** has only one Silent Hill map - it's this one, and it has a shitter! This one is brought to us by bucket brigadier **Emrysin**. I know we have seen in the past where bathrooms make great squats for would-be killers and their ofttimes victims, but here's a story that teaches us that shitters can be a bridge for community between these warring factions:
 
*"First picture is obviously a solid shot of the toilet. Actually, this bathroom has a secret passage connected to it that goes from the upstairs to the downstairs portion of the bathroom. It has pipes and things, and the only way that you can get to it is if the killer breaks open the passageway. Well, sometimes you'll encounter troll killers who are friendly and instead of killing you they fuck around with you, in a nice way. After NOT getting a troll killer for a long time, we happened to get one on this map; it was Ghost Face. In the first picture you'll see this Ghost Face who is wearing an outfit with a red demon mask and is, in fact, not murdering us. Also apparently ugly sweaters are a thing and everyone insisted upon wearing their ugly sweater.* 

*So this killer, we brought him to the bathroom. We were like, wash your hands, it's important. We kept pointing at the sinks and he did a lot of crouching up and down, and I hid in a locker, and he ripped me out of the locker to carry me (as killers do). In the last photo, the bar at the top indicates the match is ending, and so we did a crouch dance for the killer. And he was very pleased."*
