Welcome, welcome! To the thrilling, winding, epic adventure saga of *Fatal Fortress!*, an adorable tabletop game that you can find in Prey. The GM, Abigail Foy, leaves treasure maps for each of her friends, who correspond to these character sheets. Featuring such heroes as Hordinbaffle Flagdasterous, with his Staff of Flowers. He seems to take a lot of damage, and have a lot of useless things in his inventory. I think that truly, we can all learn something about ourselves through the mirror of these metaphors. The Bard looks to be doing well-off. That's what I like to see.
