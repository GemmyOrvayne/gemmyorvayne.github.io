## White House shitter!

Amazing! From bucket brigadier **Casper**, straight from Hitman: Blood Money. I'll let our brigadier take it from here: *"What you don't see is the Secret Service outside the bathroom, VERY upset with my trespassing. This is actually the most difficulty I've had looking for a toilet!*" THIS is the presidential shitter? This is a butler's broom closet! Is there even a shower? *"That was it unfortunately. It's insulting, isn't it? Haha."* What the fuck, brigade? Are we going to let these developers get away with it, or are we going to write to our State Representatives and demand better representation of government shitters? 

You don't have to answer that. Back to Casper, who gains a significant edge in the race for 2020's Brigadier of the Year with his contribution during election season! And he further promises, *"If all goes well, you may have your choice of White House toilets."* What can it mean?? I'm so excited! Tune in to blast the lid off this mystery!
