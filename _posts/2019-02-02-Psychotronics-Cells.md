## Psychotronics Holding Cell shitters!

While playing Prey, there have been moments where I realized that the fuckers working on *Talos I* got exactly what they deserved. Finding these rooms was one of those moments. Check out the shitty, dehumanizing conditions prepared for mental health ailments. The "bed" is a plywood platform with a paper-thin mattress. Or maybe it's a sofa, and they expect the person to sleep on the cot?

It has a radiator. Can we just talk about that for a second? What twisted, illiterate contractor decided this was the go-to technology for the year 2031 on a fucking *Space Station?* Why do they even need heating units like this? Doesn't *Talos I* use thermal padding and the Magnetosphere like any other structure of its kind?

You'll notice as well that there's aluminum trays, and metal cutlery. In a psychiatric ward! Maybe their excuse starts out as, "Well, we didn't anticipate we would have psych patients needing special cutlery in Outer Space." But you had the forethought to build multiple *padded cells*, so what the fuck? You have fabricators that could just poof the proper items out of polymer resin! Explain your bullshit! These aren't even the only rooms like this on the Station. Have some floor food, you breathing liability, and a journal so you can take notes on this bullshit to present to the UN later.

For future reference, being locked in a psych ward does NOT protect you from aliens. When I got to the second room, there was a mimic in there. I think it was pretending to be toilet paper. Additionally, if you had any doubts left that this place is pure simulacrum, take a look at the poster on the wall. The dude on the poster, Aaron Ingram, is the same guy you free from the experiment chamber.

It's all very sad and you can see from these photos that the residents of these cells have been here for quite some time (note the walls covered in hatch marks). At least they get a shitter, even they just have the toilet paper thrown in there on the floor like they're animals or something.
