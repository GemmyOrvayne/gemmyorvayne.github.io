#### Camp Forlorn Hope shitters!

I have mixed feelings about this place, because even though they have four structurally-sound shitters, their privacy curtains consist of heaps of garbage, and they have a real bummer of a name for their town. Honestly, I feel like I'm getting splinters just looking at those things, but I guess it's nice that they shoveled out a path in the trash so I could get to the door.
