*A couple months ago, a buddy of mine went to a local D&D event. The event was large enough that it had some corporate sponsors, including Comcast who provided internet service for the event to promote its Xfinity product. The marketing team from Comcast decided that one of the best way to spread the word at the event was to pass out free swag in the form of some custom d20 with “Xfinity” on them. Of course ad space is somewhat limited on a d20 (what with all those pesky numbers and such) so where to put it?*
<br><br>
*Well it wasn’t on the 20...it was on the opposite side.*
<br><br>
*Now to be fair, I can imagine somebody on the marketing team thought, “Hey, we’re #1! That’s the best right?” But I just can’t help appreciating the humor of seeing “Xfinity” every time someone rolls a critical fail.*
