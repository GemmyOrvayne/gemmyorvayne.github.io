## Enemy Camp shitters!

Playing through the storyline of the main *Metro: Exodus* quest will bring you to this enemy camp in the Taiga territory. The highlight of the camp is definitely this bank of outhouses! Note how the two flanking structures are blocked off, showcasing a central, slightly raised shitter, which serves an additional purpose as a shrine to a JEM! looking rockstar lady. An accordion and book stashed inside implies this shitter is a place of inspiration and culture for the people who live here. After civilization collapses you're not gonna have have a mobile phone to bring with you to the crapper, but an accordion is so much cooler.
