## Phillipi Battlefield Cemetery shitter!

Back before the bombs fell, people in Appalachia liked to reminisce about the Civil War a lot. There are a fair few monuments on the map dedicated to this purpose. One such landmark, Phillipi Battlefield Cemetery, has a gift shop in a rickety old house. If the infestation of mutated bugs doesn't exactly bother you, there's a bunch of dress-up clothes that you can rifle through and steal. In the parking lot you'll find these shitters that double as planter boxes for majestic Freedom Corn! Wow!
