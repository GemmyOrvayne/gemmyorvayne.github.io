## Camden Park shitters!

At Camden Park, you'll find no lines at the rides, the games, nor the shitters! There's also no working electricity and no First Aid Station, so watch out for broken glass. Here's a little fella who is determined to enjoy himself no matter what. He's all set with his cotton candy, his milkshake AND his beer hat, plus front-row seats to a parking lot full of explosive cars and ghouls, which makes for an exciting demolition derby.
