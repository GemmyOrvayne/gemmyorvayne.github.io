## Amh Araeng Mining Camp shitter.....?

Here's a place in Amh Araeng that will leave you asking *"...Is it?"* Near a mining camp called Nuvy's Leavings, you'll find a strange building resembling an outhouse. If you smash your camera into the door frame, you can see that there is nothing inside except some grass that clips through the raised floorboards. The unusual door on this itty bitty outbuilding begs the question. It's clearly designed to allow for visual inspection of feet beneath the door, which suggests the building is an outhouse. But if it is, it is the first such structure of its kind in Final Fantasy 14.
