## Captain America's very own shitter!

Submitted by bucket brigadier **Casper**! Can you believe this shit? This tiny-ass cramped little closet looking like it belongs in a RV is Captain America's own throne? This humble bowl? Tell us about it, Casper:

*It's inside his room on the Chimera. Well each Avenger has their own shitter, so there are tecnically 7 Avenger poopers. There is also a crew quarters, but I can't get in there, so I have no idea how many are there. Each bathroom looks the exact same, haha."

Well, there you have it, difficult as it might be to fathom that even the actor who plays Captain America would feel enthusiasm over the prospect. I'm including the second picture as proof because this is one lackluster little loo.
