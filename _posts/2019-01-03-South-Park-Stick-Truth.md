## New Kid's House shitter!

Submitted by Bucket Brigadier **Minjianaxx**, these images come from the South Park game, *The Stick of Truth.* Apparently, you can use these items as grenades (see rollover). This is an example of what not to do, the wrong kind of shit, and a misuse of a bathroom, but it's important for us to study bad behavior, so we can learn how not to be. Another example of bad behavior in this photo: Leaving your toothbrush out on the sink top in the open air of the bathroom. Gross.
