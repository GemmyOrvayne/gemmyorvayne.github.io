## Club Interior shitter!

Submitted by bucket brigadier **ThatOneCroatian**! We went on shitter safari together where he showed me how Payday 2 has shitters like these. I can't seem to correctly recall exactly what this place was because at the time there was a lot going on (explosions, flash grenades, tons of people in masks, darkness, neon lights) but I *think* this is either the interior of a club, or a bowling alley. Something like that. Payday 2's shitters are cheerful and energetic, with lots of graffiti and textural details, like this reptile-themed condom dispenser.
