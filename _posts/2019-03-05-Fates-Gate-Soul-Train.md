## Soul Train shitter!

"This particular shitter is from Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, a full conversion mod for Oblivion, and a great game. This really nice shitter actually gets its own little private room. It's located aboard the Soul Train, which transports the dead to the afterlife. I suppose this means even ghosts need to go from time to time."

A fantastic submission from Bucket Brigadier *ask-plasma*! Incredibly, this is the first and only Oblivion shitter on this blog. Some intense philosophical questions bouncing around upstairs for me on this one.
* Is the Soul Train equipped with waitstaff, or must the passenger empty their own pisspot?
- Was the Soul Train originally a civilian train for mortals? I mean, did they purchase this cable car second-hand from an auction, and that's why there's a shitter here? Or is this out of ghost-nostalgia?
+ For why is the chamber pot shaped in this manner?

These questions keep me up at night!
