## Nifty Thrifty shitter!

This a store you can enter in Tacoma Park. It has a secluded ambiance, which is something you don't really get in a lot of post-Apocalyptic shitters, but there's no toilet seat. That's okay, I'm sure there isn't one for miles. Why they felt the need to put SALE signs over the tub, I will never know, because the staff of Nifty Thrifty have been dead for hundreds of years. Make sure you shoplift the Tacoma Park Little Leaguer baseball cap from the coat rack on the way out.
