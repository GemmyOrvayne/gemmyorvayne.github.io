**Movarth Piquine** is a master vampire who is mentioned in the Skyrim book Immortal Blood. When you first enter his lair, you'll begin to see he is a collector of sorts when you witness his lackey gathering up wheelbarrows of boots from dead folks. But it isn't until you get to his private chamber that you get the full grasp of his shoe fetish. He has a lot of primo footwear shored up, including a pair called Movarth’s Boots. They're hidden from view behind his bed. The boots add 15 to Sneak, which doesn’t do Movarth any good, because he ain’t wearing them when you shoot him dead.
