## Ravina Boulevard shitters!

The following is a lesson in the wealth disparity of residents on Ravina Boulevard, located in the Palace District of Karnaca. We can see that some residents enjoy numerous creature comforts, including rugs, carved wooden cabinetry, indoor plumbing, and even lovely wall hangings. 

Other residents of the same district live in a contrast of poverty. No bathtubs here, only wash basins. They have to empty the chamber pot somewhere, and the "wall hangings" consist of peeling paper. Their very surroundings are sepia-toned.

However, perhaps "wealth" is a subjective matter. The occupant of the second residence evidently baths their feet in milk, which is quite luxurious, actually.
