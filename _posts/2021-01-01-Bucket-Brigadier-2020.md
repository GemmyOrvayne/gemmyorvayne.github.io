## The 2020 Bucket Brigadier of the Year is...

Congratulations, **Azi**! I know you thought nothing good would come out of 2020's ugly ass, but what a relief it must be to receive this honor, which you can certainly put in the "volunteer work" section of any resume. Throughout the year, Azi has been a true friend and stalwart companion, exposing me to shitters heretofore unknown. Such as the [interactive shitters of Animal Crossing](https://gaming-thrones.com/tags/animal-crossing/)! It was enough to make me want to get the game myself. Azi also waded toe-deep into [New World](https://gaming-thrones.com/2020/08/29/New-World-Dayspring.html) to find me a potty. Azi is always encouraging me by chuckling at my jokes, so I guess you could blame him for a lot of the crap that came out of this blog in 2020! Thanks a lot, Azi. This year, let's flush out even more shitters together!
