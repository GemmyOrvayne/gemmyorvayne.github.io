## Dunwall Tower Pisspot Cranny, Before and After!

Right at the beginning of Dishonored 2, you'll make your way downstairs to eavesdrop on Mortimer Ramsey and pass this nook filled floor-to-ceiling with chamber pots. They're all being used for houseplants. I thought this intriguing, but not that unusual. I, too, keep a houseplant in a chamber pot. Well, come back later when you're ready to face down Delilah and you may ask yourself, *"Am I seeing shit?"* You'll find this mess in the room where the pots used to be - This time, the plants are taking root in the floor, and the chamber pots are back to their original intended use!
