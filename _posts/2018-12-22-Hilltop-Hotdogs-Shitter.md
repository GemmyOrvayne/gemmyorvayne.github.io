#### Hilltop Hotdogs shitter!

Another mysterious magnetic fridge poem left in a shitter, this time at Hilltop Hotdogs. This one… a little less cohesive than the first. Don’t strain yourself too hard trying to find meaning in these verses. It’s clear that near the end, the author ran out of the good magnets.
