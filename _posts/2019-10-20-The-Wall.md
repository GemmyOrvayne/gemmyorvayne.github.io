## Frozen Outhouse at The Wall!

Submitted by Bucket Brigadier **ThatOneCroatian**!

The collaborative puzzle-solving game *We Were Here Together* involves the use of voice chat to pass clues to a partner and interact with objects on separate map planes. But turns out, its even more than that. Because this game has shitters, my friends!

Look at this frozen shithole. This doorless portal to ***HELL*** is located at a spot called The Wall. How would you like to sit on that? It's difficult to say for sure, but I'd call that a lethal drop. There's an elevator puzzle on this level, and I know what you're going to say, but no. The shitter itself is not part of this puzzle.
