#### Talos I Lobby shitters!

The lobby area of *Talos I* is so swanky, from the bombastic tiling, to the brass trimmings, you may pause to ask yourself, *"Am I on a Space Station, or in an overpriced hotel?"* Just look at how much Space Station real estate they wasted on a separate male and female restroom. The second photo is the Men's Room. It's in pretty good shape, and you could probably even reuse it, if you cleared out the dead guy. What's in the Women's Room (seen sealed-off in the first photo)? A devil creature from Hell, and a couple of magazines. Why did Talos I even bother with this fussy, separate male and female restrooms? At this stage, it's unclear.
