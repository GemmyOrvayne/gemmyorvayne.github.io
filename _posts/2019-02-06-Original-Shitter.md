## Sanctuary Hills custom shitter!

Fallout 4's Settlement functions allow the player to add many fun, creative structures to claimed towns. Here's a shitter I made in Sanctuary Hills. Now I know that the plumbing wouldn't really work, but if you pretend that it would, you'd probably use that enamel bucket to bring water to the bowl to make it flush. The boxes and stuff are for all kinds of supplies you'll need in an open-air shitter such as this (tp, antibacterial soap, and a .44 to fend off the radroaches). There's some lovely decor, including a rug that ought to keep down the radioactive vines and stuff. The ash tray is handy for burning some incense after you're done to keep it smelling OK. Building this for my settlers gave me a feeling of satisfaction, however, I felt that it was total bullshit that that crafting a custom shitter, with love, did nothing to improve their overall happiness.
