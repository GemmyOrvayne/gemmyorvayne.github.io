This installment of *Famous Toilet Episodes* is pulled from one of my favorite films: Mel Brooks' *Robin Hood: Men in Tights.* In this scene, Blinkin, the Loxley family servant, is "looking at porn" while 'in' the bathroom (which is really a fold-out relief on paper, because he's blind). This is a pretty standard Castle Shitter, essentially a hole in the top of a wooden box that leads 'somewhere.' We generally assume this leads to a chamber and a huge pile that some poor asshole has to shovel out, because we all know Castle Loxley didn't have running water or a sewer. Obviously Mel Brooks had a lot of influence over me growing up, because I too now believe you can't call yourself 'classic cinema' without having at least one shitter in the production.
