## Dayspring Settlement Outhouse!

Submitted by bucket brigadier **Azi**! This non-interactable outhouse is located in the settlement of Dayspring. To see inside, our intrepid brigadier had to angle his camera all crazy-like. His report: *"Since you asked, there are some shitters in New World. Extremely basic on the inside, I expect improvements before launch."* Inside the outhouse we can see there is a seat. That's good! But, I consider the amount of care and attention in the design of a game's shitters to be a reflection of the depth and detail you'll get from the gaming experience in general, so improvements? I certainly fucking hope so! Can you hear the people cry out, Amazon Game Studios? They are saying, "Make Better Shitters!"
