## Vault 76 shitter!

This pristine, exemplary, spotless, sinless, blameless restroom is pure and innocent and has done nothing wrong. This is the shitter within Vault 76 that you observe briefly before setting out into the wide wild and crazy wasteland. It's a reminder of what life could be like without the horror of nuclear war. I can't say enough about what a clean bathroom, with functioning plumbing and fluffy towels, means to me. It's the epitome of personal security and wellbeing! It's something every person should experience and feel. That's my New Year's wish for all of you, Bucket Brigade! May you shit in comfort and peace for all of 2019!
