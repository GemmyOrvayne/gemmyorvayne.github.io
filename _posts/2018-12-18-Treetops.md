High aloft the unnervingly tall oak tree of **Treetops** are numerous individual rooms decorated with a homey aesthetic. It wasnâ€™t long however before I found this gnome, and began to sweat in terror for my very life.

I also located a curious chem lab, replete with crushed acetone containers, rat poison, and gasoline. Meth kitchen, or leatherworking workshop?

At long last, I rounded the very top and saw this freak smirking at me from the edge of a precipice. I yeeted him off the brink without hesitation, and to my surprise, received 110 exp. *Ypa!*
