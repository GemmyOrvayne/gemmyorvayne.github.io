## Castle Rattay shitter!

This is a shitter that you (the main dude, Henry) may find while exploring the castle in Rattay. It's pretty great, right? I'd wager the lid (when actually in use) keeps things like bats and sparrows from coming into the castle, but you know what else would help? A door. 

You'll find this shitter on your way to a meeting with Sirs Hanush and Radzig. Here's a still frame of a cutscene from that meeting. Fun fact: One of the quests in this town is finding shit-shoveling jobs for the displaced survivors of the Skalitz massacre.
