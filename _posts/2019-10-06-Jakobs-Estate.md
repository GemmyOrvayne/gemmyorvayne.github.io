## Jakobs Estate, Eden-6 shitter!

Submitted by Bucket Brigadier **Solo Espresso**!

There's some hidden secrets in the Jakobs Estate, including a golden bust of Lenin, and a secret door behind a bookcase! But you know what else is in this zone? A shitter.

I have questions. Is the Eden-6 neighborhood a Homeowner's Association? This shitter looks remarkably similar to the one at [Blackbarrel Cellars](https://gaming-thrones.com/2019/09/30/Blackbarrel-Cellar.html), though there are certain nuanced differences. Why did both these locations require bathside gramophones? Why do both of them have crappy curtain installations - What is that filthy painter's dropcloth-looking thing hanging from above the toilet? And neither have doors. So, why doesn't Jakobs Estate deserve a nod in the Blue Bowl potentials? Simply put, this location seems to have a better grasp of fire safety, and that bores me.
