## Pi Kappa Mu shitters!

Behold a trashed party house at Fraternity Row in Morgantown. I can't say they didn't have their priorities straight when they plunked a shitter down directly on the front sidewalk.

The other shitter is in the frat house basement. I've known people who live like this, and it's impossible to interact with them. Since all the people from this frat house are skeletons, it's almost the same experience, except less talking. Note the triangular anatomy chart on the shower wall. Get a shitty education with your brain damage!
