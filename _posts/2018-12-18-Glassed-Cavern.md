#### Glassed Cavern shitter!

While gnomes are out causing mischief, teddy is here solving problems. This plucky bear is plunging with the arm of the skeleton from the potty next door. Not that the performance of this task would actually do anything to the functioning capability of the shitter, but heâ€™s trying, and therefore no one should criticize him.
