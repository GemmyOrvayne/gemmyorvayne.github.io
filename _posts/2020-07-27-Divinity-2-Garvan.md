## Driftwood Tavern shitter!

These wooden outhouses are a key component in the Divinity 2: Original Sin quest called Aggressive Takeover. The ghost of the dude who gets murdered in this quest, Liam, tells you outright the name of his killer - It's some guy named Garvan who is at a tavern in Driftwood. So when you decide, *'Yeah, it's my place to deliver the hammer of justice,'* you head to the Driftwood Tavern and somehow convince this man to eat Tainted Meat. When he inevitably gets sick, you slay him out back by the toilets. Really, the meat alone should have killed him, but I don't make the rules. 

Aside from the Tainted Meat, some other things don't sit quite right about this quest. For instance, Ghost Liam needs "proof" that you killed Garvan. Don't ghosts normally just *know* when they've been avenged? And I'm not sure how I feel about the toilets being a part of the revenge plot, because who the hell is Liam? I mean, a shitter as a quest object is always awesome, but was Liam some kind of saint? All we really know is he was a tradesperson. And *by the way*, when you find his dead body, the method by which you commune with his spirit is having an elf in your group *eat his leg*. That is just so bonkers to me.
