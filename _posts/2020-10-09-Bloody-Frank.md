## Bloody Frank's *employee restroom*!

A fun obstacle course reminiscent of one of those late-70s wooden playgrounds, *Bloody Frank's* is a gross raider restaurant with a health code rating that would make Gordon Ramsay scream like a spinto soprano. It's a teetering pile of splintered garbage, stapled together with walkways, stairs, and booby traps, all leading up to a princess parapet in the sky - and here's the princess suite. An employee's restroom where you'll find collectable loot, like Dishwasher Steve's note: A passive-aggressive, limp-dicked grievance, and the content is what you've come to expect from a disgruntled post-Apocalyptic chef. Yeah, he's irritated with life, and has the urge to chop up his comrades for the next meal. How'd you ever guess?
