## Dust District shitter!

Here's a bathroom in a residence not far from Stilton manor, with about 4 inches of silver dust piling up on the floor, and boarded-up windows that barely let the light in. Hard labor in the silver mines of Karnaca is tough, and the most na√Øve among us suffer the greatest - in this case, the shitters. Oh, don't look at me like that. The resident of this apartment didn't really *'break their back'* in Stilton Mines. They're definitely exaggerating! First of all, that slogan is slapped on walls and alleyways all up and down this street. And second, how'd they reach over the clawfoot porcelain tub like that to write on the wall with a broken back? No, the one who has it the worst is the shitter, because God knows what terrible fate befell it. My shocked face quickly shifted into my sad face when I saw this wooden potty with no chamberpot inside. Let's cross our fingers that the bowl got lucky, hopped a ferry, and is living out the rest of its days on a vineyard somewhere in Tyvia.
