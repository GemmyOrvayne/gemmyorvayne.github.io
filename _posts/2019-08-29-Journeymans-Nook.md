## Journeyman's Nook shitter!

Ever go searching for Winterhold College's missing apprentices? Here's one of them - Borvir, a barefoot corpse, lays within arm's reach of his boots, and shitter. He came out here to study mead, the production of mead, and the effects of frost magic on mead. Little did he know he would be studying nothing, because he's dead at the hands of a few bandits.
