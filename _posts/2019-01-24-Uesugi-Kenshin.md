#### Part I of the multi-part series, *"Famous Toilet Episodes:"* Uesugi Kenshin!

Here is a man considered one of the most powerful daimyo of the Sengoku period, Uesugi Kenshin, whom many believed to be an avatar of Buddha. When he became a Buddhist monk, he changed his name to Kenshin. After a life of discipline, at age 48, it is heavily implied, through historic accounts, that Kenshin was assassinated by a ninja in the toilet in his own camp.
