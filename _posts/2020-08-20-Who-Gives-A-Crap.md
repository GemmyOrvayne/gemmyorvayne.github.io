## Who Gives A Crap 

From Melbourne Australia, the [*Who Gives A Crap*](https://us.whogivesacrap.org/) company makes toilet paper and facial tissue from 100% recycled materials and/or 100% bamboo. What's so remarkable about that, I can hear you asking? They also donate 50% of profits to sanitation charity efforts like [WASH](https://blog.whogivesacrap.org/home/goodnews/what-is-wash), [SHOFCO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4k1K4zTk4w), and [WaterAid](https://www.wateraid.org/au/). Earlier this year, *Who Gives A Crap* donated *$4 MILLION* to their charity partners. That money goes to build toilets and improve sanitation services for the over TWO BILLION people on the planet without access to a decent shitter. Check out their [Talking Crap](https://blog.whogivesacrap.org/home/goodnews/our-donation-philosophy) blog for more information about their charity work. 

This toilet paper looks pretty fucking great and I really want to get myself a box of the [Play](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCo7LaIF2v9/) Edition. Themed like a toy box, the paper wrappers are cheerfully designed, and the packaging (which is both sustainably-sourced and recyclable) makes a fun and useful object even after it's empty. 

Everybody poops and as long as you're buying toilet paper, you may as well help build toilets for your fellow man by investing in a company that's doing the hard work for us: Honorary Bucket Brigadiers, *Who Gives A Crap* TP!
