## The Droughts, Pandora shitters!

When bucket brigadier **Solo Espresso** told me he was playing Borderlands 3, the first question I asked was, of course, *'Does it have shitters.'* This was his response. His commentary on these outhouses: 

*"It's a place outside the starting zone. After the intro stuff, you get this. Kind of a mini-junkyard, but it isn't. Second picture is same place as previous one, just a second one.* 

That silver beam of light looking like excalibur in the toilet is an ammo clip. The surrounding scrapheap makes for quite the dismal dump, but my *say something nice* is the colorful bunting is cheerful at best. Better than nothing, but still, it would bum me out to have to use this. 

I guess to sidestep the inevitable inquiry of who maintains these shitters, the designers popped what looks like a vacuum cleaner onto the side of them so you get the impression they are some kind of automated composting toilet. That effort is admirable, but I still have questions. As far as I can tell, there's no lore in the game that states what happens to the compost after it is processed. Does it just go into the ground? In what way does this impact the land? Is there a monster somewhere deep beneath the planet's crust who is angered by the intrusion of the compost? I get the feeling the designers don't want you to think too much about it. It's just a crapper, so move on, gamer. Well, I think about these things!
