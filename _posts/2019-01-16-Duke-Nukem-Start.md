## Duke Nukem Forever Start Point shitter!

Right away when you start Duke Nukem Forever you find yourself in this setting, which really lays the foundation for what you can expect out of the game, in the way of humor and maturity. Needless to say, I felt electrified with a feverish enthusiasm to explore this complex storyline and multifaceted main character after zoning in to a bathroom first thing. These shitters are 100% interactive, a somewhat rare quality in a game shitter.

In the very next room, you'll find this marker board which is also interactive. I was invited to use it to modify our plans as necessary, so I drew a cartoon dick. I was sure this was what they were after, and I did get praise from my friend here, but I still have a feeling that Duke is underappreciated as an artist.
