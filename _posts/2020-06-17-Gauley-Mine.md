## Gauley Mine shitter!

I could be wrong, but I *think* this was recently added! Because I have been *hunting* these shitters, let me tell you, and I did not see you here before, Gauley Mine outhouse! Look at the goodies inside. The colors are all fucky because it was night time when I found this, but I wasn't going to hang around til morning because this place is crawling with icky bugs and crispy zombies. The exterior's decoration - a crate of explosives - is a saucy wink enticing you to take a peek inside. And inside, there's gangly little teddy bears, clumps of matted, fallen leaves and part of a butter churn: An addition that is both disgusting, and at the same time so very interesting. Thumbs up to this shitter.
