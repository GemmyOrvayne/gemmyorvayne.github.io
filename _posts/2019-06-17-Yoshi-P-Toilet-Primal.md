## Stilton Manor's Alternate Future Kitchen shitter!

If there's anything that makes me hang around in a place long after beating the level, it's the promise of finding a shitter. On my way out of Stilton Manor, I crawled along the convenient shelf-style molding that wraps around the ceiling and looked for special changes. You can't imagine my excitement when I saw the storage room off the renovated kitchen was now labeled *"Restroom."* Excitedly, I did a somersault over the heads of the workmen and slipped through the door to take a look!

In the first slide, we see the storage room as it appears in 1859. Don't worry, these ladies are just sleeping. I compassionately stashed them in here so I could rummage through their kitchen properly. They'll be all right.

In the second slide, we see the room is now a shitter in the *alternate* future of 1851. It was difficult to get before and after pictures here because the room has changed so much, but this room now has two separate stalls and a utility sink.

Appreciation of the new utopia of Stilton Manor must be properly contrasted against the [shitter-less Hell that is Jindosh Mansion](https://gaming-thrones.com/2019/03/18/Clockwork-Mansion.html). And we should all be more like Aramis Stilton (artistic, thoughtful, and hygienic). Jindosh has one personal shitter, and one prison shitter for his Sokolov Holding Cell. But Stilton Manor has so many, I haven't even posted them all!
