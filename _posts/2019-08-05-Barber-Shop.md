## Karnaca Enclave Barber Shop shitter!

I've been away for a little minute taking some summer classes, but don't think I've forgotten about you, Brigade! Here's a nice spot to freshen up off the main room of a barber shop in the Karnaca Enclave. This is really an example of an excellent shitter. For the location, it's very clean. There's a lot of detail in this one - The decorative floor tiling, the busted paint job, the personal care products on the sink, even that storage locker that seems a bit out of place. It's both humble and proud, with that fantastic "I'm just doing my best" ambiance that I adore in a Shopkeeper Shitter. I like to imagine the designer getting into the mindset of the NPC who runs this place and setting up the backdrop accordingly. Definitely a blue ribbon shitter.
