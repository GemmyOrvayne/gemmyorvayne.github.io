## Dunwall Tower Passageway shitter!

Care to have dinner with Delilah the Rampaging Despot? Ms. Lucile Clothilda was invited to Dunwall Tower to do just that. I'm not sure what exactly transpired to cause her to wind up face-down in the shitter, but through careful detective work (read the letter attached to her ass) we can know that she arrived at Dunwall Tower believing that she would be treated to a sumptuous meal. Maybe her shellfish was poisoned, or maybe it was the clockwork Jindosh Soldier with the razor hands patrolling up and down the hallway, just outside this bathroom, that caused her a mortal wound? None can say for certain.
