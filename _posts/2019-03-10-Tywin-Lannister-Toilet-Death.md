## Installment #3 of Famous Toilet Episodes: Tywin Lannister's Infamous Toilet Death!

Tywin Lannister, son of Tytos and Jeyne Marbrand, is assassinated by his son Tyrion, for his crime of being a perennial and unremittent asshole. If that isn't the biggest "Oops, guess I shouldn't have dehumanized my son for the last 26 years" face I've ever seen.

This is only funny because of the jerk it happens to. While you might say to yourself, *'But I don't want to die on a toilet,'* it begs the question. At his funeral, where Tywin is arrayed in a fabulous black velvet Nightstalker Raiment, attendees remark that death on a toilet is an indignity that is uneclipsed. But could this perhaps been the *most convenient* way to croak? King Robert makes mention of, and perhaps foreshadows, the dreadful phenomenon which occurs immediately following death in [Episode 3 of Season 1!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4LSrrvh8Do)
