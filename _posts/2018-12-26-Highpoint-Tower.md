#### Highpoint Tower shitter!

Did you ever feel bad for what Neloth’s fucked up experiments did to Ildari Sarothril's sanity? Well, you won’t feel bad anymore when you see how she tortures her own prisoners by placing their shitter just out of reach! There was a lady still trapped in this dungeon when I got down here to take this picture. The compassionless disregard for the ethical treatment of prisoners is why this evil necromancer had to burn.
