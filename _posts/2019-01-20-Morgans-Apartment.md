#### Morgan Yu's Apartment shitter!

This shitter is located in your apartment when you start a new game in *Prey.* Looks pretty great, right? Real cozy? Well, guess again! This shitter is fake! It's a simulation! I know I just rocked your world and exposed the plot and revealed what you actually learn directly following the tutorial, but I thought it was essential that you know now, so you don't get your hopes up. That shitter ain't real, kid. It's a lie. There are a couple of real-deal shitters in Prey that are kind of wild, and we'll get to those. But for now this Simulated Apartment Shitter is documented here, for perspective, and posterity.
