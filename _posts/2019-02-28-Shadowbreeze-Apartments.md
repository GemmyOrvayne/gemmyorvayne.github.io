## Shadowbreeze Apartments Penthouse shitter!

This one is kind of a bummer, Brigade. It appears that rather than face the wrath of nuclear destruction, the affluent resident of this penthouse apartment paddled into the washroom in his blue bedroom slippers, boarded up the windows, and took his final bubble bath with a bottle of wine and some chems.

I've enhanced the lighting on the rollover so you can get a better look at this veritable Pharaoh's tomb! The finely-appointed shitter has a shaving station, grimy towels, a ceiling fan, and an intact mirror on an extending arm, which is very neat. This shitter looks to be the depressed, emo twin of the [shitter in Vault 76](https://gaming-thrones.com/2018/12/30/Vault-76.html), which, by comparison, is cheerful, optimistic, and has no corpses.
