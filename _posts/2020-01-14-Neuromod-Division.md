## Neuromod Division shitter!

As I creeped around the Neuromod Division I came across a baracaded men's room. By golly, I was determined to get inside and get a picture of that interior. But when I gained access to the restroom, I saw this peculiar scene. A murder! *Whodunit?* I'm going to get to the bottom of this. And it better not turn out to be that really hostile alien monster that we've been experimenting on for the last 8 months and which has currently taken over the entire space station. 

The shitters were unharmed in this scene of wanton terror.
