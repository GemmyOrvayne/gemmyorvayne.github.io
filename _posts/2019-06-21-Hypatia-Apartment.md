## Dr. Alexandria Hypatia's Apartment shitter!

This apartment is actually really pretty. It's in a historic building with a back patio, a balcony overlooking a prominent boulevard, and the windows allow for a portion of it to act as a greenhouse. This is the apartment's clean and tidy shitter. Look how pleasant and lovely it is. When Dr. Hypatia got her shit fucked up by Delilah, she abandoned all this peace, tranquility, and humble opulence for a permanent residence in Addermire Institute, surrounded by gross disease and icky death. Once you help her out (which involves injection of *Stop Killing People*), she'll move out of there, get back to being her old self, and start making pretty butterfly collections again.
