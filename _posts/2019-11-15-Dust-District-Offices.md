## Dust District Offices shitter!

You enter this building to loot petty goods via the balcony. At first, you might think there's not too much purpose to being in this building, until you realize the thrill of sneaking past the chattering secretaries, who are poised like two basilisks, typing at their desks, just to take a picture of their shitter. I felt like I was in Smaug's chamber, seeking the Arkenstone. This is just me, Corvo Baggins, hunting down the Arkenthrone.
