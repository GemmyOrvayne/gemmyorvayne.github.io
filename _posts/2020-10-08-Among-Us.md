## Medical Bay shitter!

Brought to you by bucket brigadier **Omninut**! This was the site upon which our brigadier met his painful death by getting his melon dome twisted all the way around. Is that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets I see? Omninut's commentary is as follows: *"The hole that you see next to the shitters is in fact an escape route!"* Be honest - would you use a shitter escape chute?
