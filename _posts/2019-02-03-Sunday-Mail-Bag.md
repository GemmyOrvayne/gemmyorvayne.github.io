Today's **Sunday Mail Bag** letter is the first we ever received. It's from Bucket Brigadier **drteeth76**. This fan letter was received in 2014, when we were known as *Shitters of Skyrim.* The best part of corresponding with viewers is getting to know them a bit. Fun Fact: drteeth76 and I have something in common! We both spent time as librarians.
