#### Autumn Acre Cabin shitter!

Welcome to Autumn Acre Cabin, where you can finally write the Great American Novel in peace and solitude, because you're one of the only people left alive in the country. All the comforts of home can be found here: A full kitchen, working fireplace, classical music on the radio, area rugs, and working electricity, somehow. There's even a patio that looks out over a sheer drop and is definitely unsafe. Just look at that gorgeous shitter! Wow! Watch the stars while you take a nice hot irradiated bubble bath. You might want to board that window up.
