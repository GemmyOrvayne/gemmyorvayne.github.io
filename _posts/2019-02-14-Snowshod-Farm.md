## Happy Valentine’s Day from Snow-Shod Farm!

This shot has terrible lighting, but they sleep in their basement and only have these rudimentary horn candles to see by.

A love story of pure solid gold is that of newlyweds Addvild and Leonara Arius. They work Snowshod Farm together. If you talk to Leonara, she’ll tell you about how she fled Cyrodiil, knocked on the first door she found, and it happened to be this Addvild guy. Conveniently, they fell in love! Here’s where they sleep, dress, and crap. I think they have a His and Hers thing going on.
