## Sunnytop Ski Lanes shitter!

This *pure mood* from Appalachia sums it all up pretty fast - "Slumped backwards over the shitter with some booze" is how we're all feeling, sweetie. Don't worry, there's an unoccupied stump of a throne in the back so you can flop over, too. At least there's plenty of toilet paper to go around.
