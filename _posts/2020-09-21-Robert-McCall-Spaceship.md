## 2001: A Space Odyssey Concept Art

*"If you saw Stanley Kubrickâ€™s classic motion picture 2001: A Space Odyssey, chances are you were attracted to it by posters featuring the paintings of Robert McCall. His vision of the wheel-shaped space station and of space-suited astronauts on the Moon have adorned movie theaters and art museums around the world."*
