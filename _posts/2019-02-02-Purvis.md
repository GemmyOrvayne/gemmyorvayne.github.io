This **Cargo Bay Container Hidey-Hole** belongs to Quentin Purvis, deceased. While not a true shitter, I thought it prudent to include this rather ridiculous display in the collection due to Mr. Purvis' forethought of including toilet paper in his secret hiding place.

The full story here is Quentin Purvis got wind of something terrible happening, or going to happen, to *Talos I.* So naturally, he hoarded packaged food from the Dining Hall, and some markers to huff, and shut himself up in a shipping container. I'm guessing he thought this container would be safe from the aliens. Maybe he thought it was going to get loaded onto an outbound ship and he would be headed safely to Earth soon enough. Unfortunately for him, he never packed any O2 tanks and died of asphyxiation while the station was locked down in quarantine. But packing toilet paper was a great idea.
