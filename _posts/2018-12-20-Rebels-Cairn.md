## Rebel's Cairn shitter!

Another hidden shitter in Skyrim! This starts out as a sword, named Red Eagle's Fury, which can be inserted into a stone plinth at Rebel's Cairn to trigger a trap door in the cave. If you complete the quest, and kill the draugr Red Eagle, you'd remove the sword to reveal its name has changed to Red Eagle's Bane. Or, you could set it on fire, and turn it into a bucket, like I have demonstrated here.
