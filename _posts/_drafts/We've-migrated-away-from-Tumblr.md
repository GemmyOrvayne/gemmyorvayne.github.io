A combination of Tumblr's codebase being limiting or difficult to work with, and their recent changes to their definition of censorship, has prompted this change.

But I think this will be a good change! We were getting too comfortable on Tumblr, anyway. "Fat as a buttered bishop," as Osferth of Wessex would say. So now we have a new layout and banner, and some new features coming soon. Enjoy!!
