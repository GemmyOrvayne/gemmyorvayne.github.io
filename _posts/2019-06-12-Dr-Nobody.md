## Dr. Nobody's Sanctum of Misery shitters!

Here's another slide for our presentation of "Emily Kaldwin Should Not Be Empress." This bloodfly-riddled apartment in the Dust District is supposed to be a "Doctor's Office." I'm sure it was at some point, but a *while back* it became a portal to Hell. Based on cursory observation, Nature has been reclaiming this building for a lot longer than a few weeks or days.

For those of us who like to keep receipts, here's an Accounting Book that Dr. Nobody kept of all his snake oil sales. Can't sleep? Eat some onions! Everyone knows *that*. Poor Mr. Viteri (the final entry) was a dead man walking after the Doctor's "treatment," but isn't it slightly heartening that this charlatan never actually collected *money* for his goofery? No? Well, at least Doc is probably dead now, and we can all sleep a little better at night knowing Corvo Attano fumigated this apartment with fire to clear out the bloodflies.
