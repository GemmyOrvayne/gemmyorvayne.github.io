## Mystery Lake Outhouse!

Finding bathrooms is always the best part of playing any game, and I was pleased when I located this outhouse next to a cabin near Mystery Lake. It can be found on the western edge of the map, north of the Trapper's Homestead. Its green door is very attractive. Sadly, it seems that shitters in The Long Dark are mere aesthetic props added for ambience, as this outhouse could not be entered, nor interacted with in any way.
