#### Burrows Lighthouse Shitter!

The swankiest shitter in Dunwall. This is even nicer than the toilets at the Boyle mansion. There are clean linens laid out for Admiral Farley Havelock to wipe the blood of the Loyalists from his hands. All the utilities work (more than what you can say for the entire city of Dunwall). This interior design really has that 'Grand and Stately Bullshit Rumored to be Classy' *Look,* and itâ€™s ghastly.
