## Condemned Bar's shitter!

Submitted by Bucket Brigadier **Khazya**! This shitter is located at a defunct saloon. You'll find it near the beginning of the Addermire Institute mission. I'm really into these humble-proud Shopkeeper Shitters lately. Given how poorly the rest of this building is looking, the barkeep has kept his personal space quite neat and tidy in contrast! His affairs are all in order on that desk. The blankets are folded very nicely! He's trying so hard to keep semblance of order in this crock of shit that we call The Empire of the Isles. Doing his duty! If this guy traded spots with Emily Kaldwin for a day, I think we'd see at least some of the daily necessities addressed.
