## Dunwall Storage Hallway shitter - Post-Delilah Takeover!

Remember the unexpected [storage hallway shitter](https://gaming-thrones.com/2019/04/08/Dunwall-Tower-Storage-Room.html) that caught you unawares, right before you left Dunwall Tower? Well look who's still here at the end of the game, waiting right by the door when you return home, like a grizzled, faithful hound!

Has your old pal, Hall Shitter, suffered from use, disrespect, and maltreatment since you've been gone? I don't think so. From the looks of it, Hall Shitter was picked up with the entire grouping of backwards-facing paintings and elevated just a few inches higher onto a desk. Other than that, it seems to be in one piece, apart from just having missed you so darn much while you were away. Now if you're wondering about the wellbeing of the Brigmore Witch pictured here, yes, that bitch is dead. I was playing High Chaos, so I had very little other option.
