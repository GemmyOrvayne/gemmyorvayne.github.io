#### Embershard Mine shitters!

Don’t want an excess of poo poo stink when you’re down in the mines. Top photo is where the bandits shit. Bottom photo is the cruel conditions under which they force their prisoners to shit! Given the discrepancy in quality between the household bucket vs. the guest bucket, I am going to wager to guess that these bandits didn't contribute much to the construction of these facilities. They most likely stole it from someone decent, and just stuck their name on it.
