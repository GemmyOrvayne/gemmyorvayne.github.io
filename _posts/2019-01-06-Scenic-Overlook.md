## Scenic Overlook shitter!

Oh, look. Someone was making hot dogs over the crapper. Why does everyone in Appalachia seem to think this is such a great idea? I mean, *you could always build a fire.* Or, if you're trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself, eat the hot dogs raw! It's not even real meat! What harm could you really do eating it uncooked? Are you really improving this item by altering it in this manner? Actually, the better question is, *Did you get a head injury out there?* Because you are NOT cooking the item by doing what it shows in this picture.
