#### Gallows Rock shitter!

At least, I am pretty sure this is the spot to squat for the werewolf hunting group known as the Silver Hand. Itâ€™s pretty messed up, but the entire fort here is filthy and disgusting so, what do you want. All the hallmarks of a shitter are here, including bucket, shovel, and book, as well as that crate where I'm assuming they place the book when it's not strewn on the fucking floor. These guys are way more interested in skinning werewolves alive than keeping house. They are enormous assholes.
