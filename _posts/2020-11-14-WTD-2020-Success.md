## WTO World Toilet Day Charity Drive was a Complete Success!

We did it, brigade! Thanks to bucket brigadier Omninuts and his Nutsack community on Twitch, we not only met our goal of $400 (Singapore), we blasted right past it! As of this morning, [our campaign has raised $729](https://worldtoilet.give.asia/campaign/gaming-thrones-the-bucket-brigade-wto-charity-drive#/) - and it's not even over! We still have until November 18 at midnight to raise as much as possible for the World Toilet Organization. The incredible success of this campaign has brought new light to my heart and I am more determined than ever to bring you top notch gaming shitters. So I have decided that for every Bucket Brigade submission of a new shitter, I will donate five dollars to this cause. It is going to really add up and I'm very excited to post a new shitter submission link on the page. This submitter will be available shortly. Check it out and send those shitters.
