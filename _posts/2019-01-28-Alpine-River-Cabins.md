## Alpine River Cabins shitter!

Having a small business wasn't enough for the guy who used to run this vacation destination. In a bid for a spot on Haunted Tours of West Virginia, the cabins were wired so the paintings would rotate and the floors would shake. There are a number of buildings at this location, along with some outdoor cook areas, but just one outhouse.

Here's the Most Haunted Shitter in Appalachia. Note the secondary bucket inside the stall. There's also a rocking chair outside. Maybe it creaks ominously when you approach, I don't know. But there's a water pump for washing your hands after, and the fact there's a functioning door is enough for me; I'm sold.
