## Test Chamber 00 shitter!

*Portal* begins in this exhibitionist's cube - or "Relaxation Vault" - its sole purpose being for you to escape it. Alongside your cozy bed and a small table where someone has inconsiderately left behind a dirty coffee mug and testing data, we find the real star of the scene. The shitter itself is oddly spherical, and even stranger, there is no portal inside the bowl which would eliminate the need for plumbing.
