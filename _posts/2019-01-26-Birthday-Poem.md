## A Birthday Poem

*Gray walls, impenetrable steel.*

*Suffocation! Condemnation!*

*Little hands groping in subterranean uncertainty.*

*Mommy? Daddy? Am I dead?*

*Nay! Nay! Reborn into purifying fluorescence!*


*A face emerges, strong and male.*

*Father to me? Father to all!*

*Overseeing our lives, our eternities.*

*Harshness of discipline. Harshness of love.*

*Obedience my savior!*


*Larva to pupa, pupa to worker.*

*Buzz, buzz! One with the steel honeycomb.*

*10 lies within the 101, significant at last.*

*Till gray seeps from walls to hair, to soul.*

*Then, eternal slumber, the sweet sleep of incineration.*
