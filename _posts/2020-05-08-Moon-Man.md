## *"Where can I get a helmet like that?"*

Martin Callahan, *Spacer's Choice* representative and vendor who wears what is basically the pinnacle of fashion - a ping pong ball helmet, somehow internally-lit, which he may never remove. We know from reading his email (he's still logged in at a public terminal in the main thoroughfare of the *Groundbreaker*) that the inside of the helmet is riddled with evidence of countless previous users. What a choice. Spacer's Choice.
