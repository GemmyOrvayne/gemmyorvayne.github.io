## Psychotronics shitter!

I know there's a half-dead alien blob pinned in the bowl by a wrench somebody threw before fleeing in terror. But the other shitter here still works, so have at it.

Take note as well that this bathroom is absolutely *fucked.* For Morgan Yu, the main character, this crisis began only hours ago. But how long has this really been going on for? Almost all the floor tiles have been ripped off, and the electrical wiring has shitted out. Once you've completed the game, this kind of thing is an interesting detail on the subconscious of the story.
