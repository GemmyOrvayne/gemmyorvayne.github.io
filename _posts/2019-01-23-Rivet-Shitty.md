## Rivet City shitters!

*Rivet Shitty*. I have my doubts about this one. Though it may be possible that all these fixtures are actually hooked up to working plumbing, they never bothered to get around to tossing up some privacy curtains and the place is *filthy*. This is the one place they really should be cleaning. And I know for a fact that Abraxo exists in this town. Moreover, given there's a makeshift bar littered with hooch, I'm wondering if this is where survivors of the Apocalypse go to cry. This room reminds me a lot of Skyrim's Redwater Den. I'm surprised there aren't pinch pots of moon sugar on that table.
