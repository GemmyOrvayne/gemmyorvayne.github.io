## Kiddie Corner Cabins shitter!

*Nyeehehe! Yes, yes! Do come in!*

Here we see the Common Garden Gnome in his natural habitat: An acid-bath of humanity's collective sorrow and regrets. Yes, do come closer! Partake in the hospitality of his beautiful home, this pastoral lakeside getaway! Where only scientifically-unknown bacteria, and Ghouls, can survive.

Kiddie Corner Cabins are a series of small wooden buildings that have seen some shit. The potty stall is still standing, but so is a crisp husk of a dead chump, right in the doorway, so that's a no-go. There's a dinner tray in there, and some TP, as if they'd ever see use again.

Despite the carnage, or perhaps especially because of it, this shitter is a role model and a champ. Everything else around it has given in to the pressure, and crumbled to crap, but this shitter is still upright and proud, because it has nothing to be ashamed of.
