## More Seneca Gang shitters?!

Can you believe that Seneca Gang has even MORE shitters on their (abandoned) property? I was on a second trip to the camp to visit [the best of the gondola shitters](https://gaming-thrones.com/2018/12/14/Seneca-Gang-Camp-Shitter.html), and I was completely bowled over to find they *also* have these sweet shitters that are not exactly shitters? They're the shells of outhouses but have been repurposed into.. stuff.... Here's one, it's some kind of hideout, a looky-loo if you will, with a little chair for upon which a CREEPER may perch, *perfect* for an evil gnome. How would you like to round the corner and see that?

And this one! Sick, dude! I would expect nothing less from my boys the Seneca Gang. Here's a shitter that's -- OH, SHIT! The switcheroo! It's really a shot gun that will blast your ass, if you don't watch your ass! But honestly, by now we all know to walk around these things with EXTREME caution.
