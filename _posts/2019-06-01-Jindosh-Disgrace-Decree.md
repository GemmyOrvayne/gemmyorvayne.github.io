## Kirin Jindosh's Certificate of Failure!

*Lookie what I found!* Hidden away in a closet, alongside a bunch of gross "laboratory reagents", Kirin Jindosh keeps some Revenge Fuel framed and under glass. This Decree of Shame, and dare we say Dishonor?, is an official proclamation stating Dunwall is not here for your messy, sinful ways! Even the Electromagnetism Council, who cosigned this, doesn't want to be seen with Kirin Jindosh.
