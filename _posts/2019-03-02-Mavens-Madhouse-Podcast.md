## Nerds On Display Podcast!

Last night I was a guest on Nerds On Display, hosted by Maven from Maven's Madhouse! I got to meet five great streamers with varying points of focus. We talked about the future of E-Sports, the appeal of mainstream anime, cosplay as an artform and career, games as social gathering hubs, as well a other topics. There's a little segment about Gaming Thrones around the 2 hr. 15 min. mark!
