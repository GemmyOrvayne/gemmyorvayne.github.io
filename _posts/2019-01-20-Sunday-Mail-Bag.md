Today's **Sunday Mail Bag** letter comes from loyal Bucket Brigadier **imsopopfly**. This fan letter was sent in November of 2018, while we were still on Tumblr. Notes like these are dear to my heart. I really treasure that you have been following my adventures for so long. Thank you for your support, Brigadier!

Here are some things that will be coming soon to Gaming Thrones!
* Shitter Submitter! You will be able to submit your own screenshots to Gaming Thrones.
- Mailbag! Send a personal message directly to the author of this blog.
+ A Surprise!!
  - There will soon be a brand new interactive link on the lefthand nav bar that I'm eager to share with you, and that I hope each and every Bucket Brigadier will visit, when it is added to the site.

That's all for now! As always, thank you for your readership.
