## Dunwall Tower shitter!

This one is a little fucky, but I'm not convinced that it's the shitter's fault. You can see the chamberpot is clipping into the wooden seat of the shitter. Is it trying to run? Maybe it has to do with the fact that there's a *highly combustible drum of whale oil,* alongside the open fucking flame of a lantern mere feet from where you are supposed to feel most at ease. The wooden hinged lid is spattered with whale oil. This room reminds me a lot of [this](https://gaming-thrones.com/2019/02/16/Prey-Deep-Storage.html) shitter on *Talos I.* The rogue government of Gristol can make hydraulic super soldiers that shoot rockets with no problem, but trust them to jerry rig a veritable bomb in a restroom. What a filthy debacle.
