## Battleship Bay shitters!

These shitters are brought to you by Bucket Brigadier **Minjianaxx!** The bathrooms at this entertainment resort are segregated, with obnoxious, rude signs indicating where it is legal or illegal to shit. The nerve of this place. You can't tell me where to squat.


First we see the "Whites Only" restroom, and if you live in the sky city of Columbia, there is definitely something in the water making you stupid if you saw this and never thought it was bullshit. Velvet drapes? Gross!! The toilet seats don't even have real lids on them. Every time you flush, there's a fine mist coating these curtains, and then you're *touching them!* The fussy granite urinals positively scream "You're trying too hard, Prophet." Additionally, somebody left food in this purse on the floor. Would you eat a shitter apple?


Apart from this, we also have the "Colored/Irish" restroom, which is, well, *different,* by comparison. The Prophet obviously didn't shell out the big bucks for contractors on these sinks. Though I have to say, I do not think what is happening with that one sink is actually possible. Princess Comstock will carry on about how it smells in here, right in front of this guy who is just doing his best with what he has to work with. He's trying so hard, so back off, Elizabeth. Lastly, the "urinal station" is just a trough in the floor. This design element is quite popular in some punk rock clubs in Los Angeles, so maybe they're onto something.
