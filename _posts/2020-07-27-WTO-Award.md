## We are officially friends!

We are so thrilled and so proud to announce that the World Toilet Organization has given this incredible Certificate of Friendship to Gaming Thrones. A beautiful plaque which I am proud to hang on my wall. The design is in a handsome and stylish toilet bowl blue, and signed by my hero Jack Sim, so I actually have his autograph now. 

I would like to take this opportunity to mention that during this time of global awareness around COVID-19 and the coronavirus pandemic, proper sanitation is of paramount importance. The necessity is poignant that all people have access to this basic human right - a safe and clean toilet. And because I know that my Bucket Brigade is as equally passionate about toilets, I am asking you to please celebrate Friendship Day with us by navigating to [the World Toilet Organization](https://www.worldtoilet.org/) to make a secure donation of $5. You can donate with PayPal, and there's even a recurring payment option. For the price of a coffee, we can make a difference. 

Thank you for celebrating Friendship Day, July 25, along with me and Jack Sim!
