## Taiga Farmhouse shitter!

Greetings from scenic Taiga! When you first enter this zone, there's a whole kerfuffle as you're ambushed by a forest tribe, and then rescued from drowning by a beautiful forest warrior. When you finally stagger to your feet, you're outside a tumbledown farmhouse. And right there, this gorgeous, rustic shitter is waiting for you; its door open wide, without words it seems to ask, "Are you okay?" There's even a heart on the door! A great omen right at the start of this zone.
