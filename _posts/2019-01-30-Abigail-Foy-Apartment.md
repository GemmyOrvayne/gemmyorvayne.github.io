As you explore *Talos I* you are led to believe that Alex Yu is the most privileged entity on the Station. But you were utterly deceived. Because clearly Abigail Foy, GM of the tabletop roleplaying game Fatal Fortress, had the sweetest hookup of all when she was permitted to transform her apartment into a gaming paradise. When she's just not feeling like uncovering the mysteries of the universe using Science, she just flops on the floor with her friends with some snacks or plays pinball with the actual pinball machine in her entryway. The last picture is the message you get when you hack into her computer. Whether this results in a buff or a virus in your suit interface depends on how much of her Fatal Fortress game you completed.
