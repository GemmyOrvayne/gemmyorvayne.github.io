## Abernathy Farm shitter!

It was never clear to me why Raiders were always harassing Abernathy Farm. I mean, aside from the fact that Raiders are simple-minded assholes who crush anything good, but Abernathy Farm doesn't even have a decent shitter. This craptastic pile of broken porcelain is the only thing close to one, and it's located *just outside* the boundaries of the farm.
