## Distillery District shitter!

The most no-nonsense shitter of them all, full of shiny loots and resting alongside a stack of books to ponder. The noble chamber pot, located in a nook of the Distillery District, is primarily used by Slackjaw's gang. But don't think this is enough for the likes of The Bottlestreet Gang. There's something beautiful about a bunch of big 'n tall thugs perching delicately on the edge of a porcelain saucer.

And if you want insight into class disparity during Gristol's rat plague, compare this hovel to the carved, solid walnut in the [Boyle Mansion shitters](https://gaming-thrones.com/2019/03/13/Boyle-Mansion.html).
