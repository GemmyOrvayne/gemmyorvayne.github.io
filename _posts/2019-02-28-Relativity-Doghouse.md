## Einstein's field equation concerning the nature of the universe appears in this doghouse. Interesting point of fact: The cosmological constant Λ was posited to allow for a universe that is not expanding or contracting. Observations by Edwin Hubble confirmed that our universe is expanding, so Einstein abandoned Λ, calling it the "biggest blunder [he] ever made." You can read more about Einstein's theory of relativity at [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations).
