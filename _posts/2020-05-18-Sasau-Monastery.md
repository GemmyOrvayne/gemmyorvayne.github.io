## Sasau Monastery shitter!

The personal shitter of Baron Sebastian vom Berg! **This** one, in a private bedchamber and NOT a public hallway, has a door! It also has a bucket. In my experience, a bucket of this time period placed thusly is a sufficient shitter, but this monastery bedroom gets a little of both.
