## Stilton Attic - Shitty Lie!

I'm sure many Bucket Brigadiers can identify with the story of disappointment that I am about to share. While on Shitter Safari, wandering through the dilapidated ruin of Stilton Manor, I looked up to see this a promising location for a shitter sighting. Yes, my heart leapt as I parkoured up some bookshelves, chandeliers and broken beams into Stilton's attic. But just as a twinkling gem on a riverbed turns out to be merely some glass from a beer bottle, there was no shitter here! Such is the danger of getting one's hopes up. I even used the Outsider's Timepiece, desperately hoping to at least find a chamber pot in the past, but this attic was just a housing for a spare bathtub. What a letdown!
