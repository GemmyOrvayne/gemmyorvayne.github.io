## Foundation shitters!

While strolling around the township of Foundation, you'll find these two basic-bitch wooden potty stalls. They're identical, and even the toilet paper inside has been placed in the exact spot within each. But these no-nonsense shitters aren't the only squats to spot here at Foundation. Within the underground part of the town, there's this other rather gorgeous shitter, lit from above with the golden light of ~~heaven~~ a single bare bulb. The metal push-button toilet is very industrial-chic for sure, but here's the awkward problem - according to [US Patent #5291620A](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5291620A/en), this type of toilet wasn't invented until 1993 - far outside the timeline in which the Fallout story takes place. It's also not exactly functional because the lid doesn't raise, but it's a nice art piece.
