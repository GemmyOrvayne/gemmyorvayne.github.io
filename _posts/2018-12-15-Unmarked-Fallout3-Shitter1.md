## Unmarked Shitter, north of MDPL Relay Station

This fishing shanty from straight out of your nightmares has the works. Rusted slap-shod hut, boats sunken into radioactive muck, and a shitter that makes you hear phantom pipe organ music over the pounding of your heartbeat. As youâ€™re backing away, careful not to trip over the pile of six dead bodies; some fresh, some merely bones.
