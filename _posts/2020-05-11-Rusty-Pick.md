## The Rusty Pick shitters!

Every now and then a game redeems itself with some top notch shitters. Say what you will about nearly everything having to do with Fallout 76, but the shitter safaris almost always bring home a trophy. 

Here's the men's and women's restrooms at The Rusty Pick, an odd little shoppe where you can exchange scrips for legendary items. The women's room is completely blocked off as storage for arcade cabinets, because we know what a barrel of fun it is to be a chick during the apocalypse. It looks like the the shopkeeper (a mole*woman*?) has designated this as an employees-only lavatory. 
The men's room is where all the action happens. I guess this is how molepeople think humans live. Mole Girl has collected dressmaker's ephemera and nailed it along the walls for that "huh?" element. With two stalls conveniently separated by the unparalleled privacy of chainlink fencing, there is also a bank of urinals, and a tinker's bench, in case you want to touch things and do fine craftwork while you're in there. At least there are sinks.
