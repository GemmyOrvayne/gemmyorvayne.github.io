## November 19 is World Toilet Day 2020!

Every year on November 19, the [World Toilet Organization](https://www.worldtoilet.org/) celebrates their victories, outlines new goals, and presents their plea to the world at large for donations to their incredible charity effort to bring safe and clean toilets to underserved communities. Just some of their projects this year included waterless composting toilets in Xi`an City, China! The WTO also expanded their Rainbow School Toilet Program in China. You can read their Annual Report from 2019 [here](https://worldtoilet.org/wp-content/uploads/AnnualReports/WTO_AnnualReport_2019.pdf), and please look forward to their updated 2020 Annual Report in the coming days. 

Bucket Brigade, this year we are doing something special for our friends at the World Toilet Organization. The Gaming Thrones community is seeking to raise $400 (Singapore) before World Toilet Day - November 19 - to add to the WTO yearly goal! Whether you are a veteran brigadier, or if you wish to join the ranks as a new member: **Please consider being part of our charity drive by making a secure PayPal donation [via our Campaign Link!](worldtoilet.give.asia/gamingthroneswtodrive)** You can give any amount - even a donation of $5 will help us reach our goal. What might seem like a drop in the bucket can add up significantly! You'll be a part of making a world of difference for a person you may never meet, but who will thank you multiple times daily. Additionally, myself, and the WTO at large will sincerely thank you for your contribution. *To ensure the funds get to the destination before World Toilet Day, the fundraising will close on November 18, 2020 at midnight.*
