## Slave "Quarters" shitters!

This one is hard to look at, brigade. So if you have a heart beating inside your chest it is gonna ache when you get a load of this shit. 

In the Caspian Sea segment of Metro: Exodus you'll have to crawl through a sewer, and within the caverns you'll find a truly terrible sight. Some group associated with The Baron keeps slaves down here. There are vicious dogs, cages for animals and people alike, cardboard sleeping mats, and just all around heartbreaking shit. It's hard to look at, but note how the slaves have to sleep right next to the shitters. No one should have to live like this. The Baron and his evil crew truly have no humanity, and deserve everything they get. I came back through here after my no-kill run and cracked their skulls like watermelons!
