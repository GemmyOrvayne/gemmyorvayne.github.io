## Duke Abele's Royal Guards' shitter!

The Duke lives steeped in opulence in the nouveau-riche, modern expressionist Royal Palace, that sports a ghastly cast plaster exterior. Aramis Stilton has more taste, and I think the Duke is trying to play catch-up. Abele spent a lot of cash on his palace, but cut corners on the facilities for his support staff. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want to shit here. It is slightly less dreary than a workcamp barracks, and Duke Abele obviously didn't feel the need to spring for any kind of floor coverings, a second sink, or even a second coat of paint. The shitter itself is fine; it is innocent, and is just trying to do its job.

In case you were wondering, no, I didn't incapacitate these guards, they were already slumped over *drunk* when I got here!
