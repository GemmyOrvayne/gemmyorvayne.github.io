## We're back, Brigade!

A belated Happy Pride, brigadiers! Life has been pretty incredible lately but I'm happy to report that first of all, I am alive! Due to some pretty wild circumstances, I have been unable to update the blog for just about 6 full months. But the stars aligned and not only are we back but we have so many - LOADS - of brigadier-submitted shitters queued up and waiting to be analyzed, critiqued, praised and/or ridiculed. I'm very excited to share them with you, so please look forward to that. Enjoy these last proud days of June and then get ready for Christmas in July, Gaming Thrones style!
