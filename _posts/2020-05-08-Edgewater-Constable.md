## Edgewater Constabulary shitter!

Something you learn right away when playing the Outer Worlds is that in this universe, the wrong people always get locked up. And this is just one of the places where innocent people are held for bad reasons - the Edgewater Constabulary! The stupid trick doing paperwork has decent *intentions* I suppose, but watch how it absolutely blows her mind when you don't immediately rat on the guy who saved your life in the first 3 minutes of the game, the "notorious criminal" Phineas Welles. 

Wonderful example of a classic prison shitter. The spot where ya crap is in full view of the front door to the Constabulary, and the "public shower" flooring, somehow coated in standing water though the cell remains empty, only adds to the total fucking bummer this place is.
