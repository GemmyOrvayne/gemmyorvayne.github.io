## Bolton Greens shitter!

Hey, little buddy, you're far from home. This gondola shitter is oddly placed in an overgrown meadow of lush grasses and defunct appliances. A scorched wastelander extends an arm toward the bowl, as though expecting salvation. In another lifetime, perhaps.

Anyway, if you don't like the looks of this restroom, that's too bad, because there are no other toilets on the grounds of Bolton Greens. The closest you're going to get is what you see in the second picture. How'd you like to freshen up in this powder room?
