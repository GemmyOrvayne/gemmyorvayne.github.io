## Unmarked Solstheim Campsite shitter!

Responsible campsite upkeep is important. You don't want to be creating a mess for future campers. The Golden Rule of camping in Skyrim is: *Take only deer pelts, butterfly wings, thistle, hawk feathers, spiky grass, and Dragon Priest artifacts; leave only footprints.*
