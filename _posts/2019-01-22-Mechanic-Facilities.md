## Mechanic Facilities/Locker Room shitter!

In the "facilities" area of the Mechanics Division you'll find this area labeled "Locker Room." But it wears many hats, and functions as a shitter, and compact office for the scholar searching for reasons why the people on *Talos I* deserve to live. It's even a secret loot chamber. After you successfully launch Emmanuella and Frank's escape pod, you learn that Emmanuella left a little goodie bag hidden in that room. Just take it, barely anybody else is even alive to appreciate it.
