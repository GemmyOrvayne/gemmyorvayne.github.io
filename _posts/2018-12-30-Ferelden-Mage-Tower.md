*"I DID IT! I FOUND A SHITTER! STALLS AND EVERYTHING! This is the mages tower, in the place the students sleep. It's in the continent of Ferelden, next to the docks. You have to talk to a Templar to boat you across a river to get to it. You save the tower from one of the mages who went crazy and summoned leagues of demons inside. Last time I was in the mages tower, all the shitters were tossed willy nilly around, cuz of all the demons killing people, but if you go back during the dlc, it's all tidy. Well, the destroyed version just had like one or two buckets with a shower tub just tossed in the corner. It's why I couldn't see what the room was made for with my UNTRAINED EYE."*
