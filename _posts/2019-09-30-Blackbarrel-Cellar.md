## Blackbarrel Cellars, Eden-6 shitter!

Submitted by Bucket Brigadier **Solo Espresso**!

This shitter is fantastic. What am I looking at here? Someone in the tub with a TV head? Is the person dead? Is that someone relevant to the story in any way? Is that a gramophone, or something like it?
Detective Espresso has the answers!

*"Yeah, apparently. I have no clue, it's no one important. Just a random idiot mob. And that is a gramophone, I think it's what it's called, in the game. It's such a pretty bathroom, and I love everything in it."*

It is pretty great. But you know what, Borderlands 3, you are really showing your ass here. The curtains are clipping into the walls. The pipes are wrapping *around* some of the curtains - how doth one closeth thine drapery? And my favorite thing used to be rugs with unfixable wrinkles. My *new* favorite thing is wrinkled carpet with candles that have been left burning on top of them. This crapper is a tinderbox. Yikes.

*This shitter is a contender for the esteemed Blue Bowl of 2019.*
