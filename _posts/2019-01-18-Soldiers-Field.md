## Soldier's Field shitters!

Another 'amusement park' in Columbia, Soldier's Field features a baffling puzzle that only the most discerning simpleton could ever solve.

In the first photo, we see the Men's Room (you can tell it's a Men's Room because it has a dead dude in it) with a crass graffito scrawled across the urinal station. Elizabeth suggests you start looking for clues. Luckily for you, a huge clue to what the mysterious message says can be found *in the hand of the corpse on the floor*.

Follow the clue to discover a secret door in a location that is pretty much shouting "This right here is a secret door." It's in the empty stall in the adjacent Women's Room. Sleuthy!
