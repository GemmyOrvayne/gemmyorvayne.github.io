**Seneca Gang Camp Shitter!**

This crashed gondola car has been repurposed by these inventive [dead] raiders into a really fancy piss pot! They hauled it all the way up to this rock outcropping for a high-art, high-altitude shitter. This was well worth their trouble, even if they are all dead now and their camp is occupied by Super Mutants, because they left something their descendants could have been proud of. Stephen Hawking remarked that your focus should be on your legacy or what you are able to leave behind after you are gone, and this is Seneca Gang's legacy!
