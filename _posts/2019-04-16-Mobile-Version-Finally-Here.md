## We finally have a Mobile Version!

"It's not flawless, but it's here" is what the delivery doctor said when they handed Baby Ulfric Stormcloak to his mother. It's also the announcement I'm making today about the new mobile version of Gaming Thrones! I'm very excited to present this mobile version, as it is the result of a lot of hard work. It will probably receive numerous adjustments in the coming days, but it is my hope that this new application will be exactly what the Bucket Brigade needs when you're on the go. To properly view the mobile theme, you might have to flush the cached data from when you viewed the site previously with your device.

Thanks for your continued viewership, Bucket Brigade!
