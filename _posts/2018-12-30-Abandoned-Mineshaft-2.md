#### Abandoned Mineshaft 2 shitter!

Years of shitter hunting has hyper-attuned my senses! It was the pitch black of night when I snuck up on this place. When I suddenly found myself stumbling through a slap shod pile of broken metal sheeting, I paused a moment and thought, "I bet this is a shitter." Sure enough, I circled around and voila, a broken toilet! I don't think this object originated here. One of the metal signs on the outside depicts a swimmer.
