## Graninger Farm shitter!

Hey, sweet digs. This sprawling, three bedroom farmhouse (that's debatable, but there *are* three beds, including a double bed, a little mattress on the floor, and the *skeleton* of a bed half-hidden under rubble) has every trimmin' and fixin' you could desire! You get a floor safe, two radios, a culinary cauldron, and one very large skylight. Note the tub propped against the wall like a coffin for a shitter vampire. This location is special because you can find a rare plushie here named "Pristine Teddy Bear"! The wikia describes it as a "junk item." That's rude.
