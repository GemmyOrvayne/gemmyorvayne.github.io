## Brandywine Drop Overlook Outhouse!

Bucket Brigadier *Casper* submitted this pastoral cliffside shitter! It's empty. You don't get a door, but it's positioned facing away from a fenced cliff's edge, so at least you'll see if a bear is coming right at you. Do you think the fear element is a help, or a hindrance to use of this facility?
