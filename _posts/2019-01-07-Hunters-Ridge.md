## Hunter's Ridge <strike>shitter</strike> urinal!

Not a true shitter, unless you are a savage freak, but it deserves a mention for the following reasons: The extraneous floral arrangement, the gnome Honor Guard, and the splashmat of mutated fungus make this a rest stop of note. Something else to make note of is that while all the residents of Hunter's Ridge are corpses, this gnome remains on site, with his unnerving, emotionless grin. Shocking, I know.
