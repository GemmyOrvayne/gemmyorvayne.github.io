## Addermire Recuperation shitter!

Y'all ready to recuperate? Head to the Addermire Institute of Infectious Diseases, where this bunk is reserved just for you and your recuperation. These are the amenities that await you here: A minibar filled with ether and highly flammable liquor! Loads of cheery sunlight just streaming through the windows! The ambient sounds of bloodflies nesting in the walls! Natural grass flooring? And a chamber pot that is mostly yours, mere inches from your pillow. Plus, the Good Doctor's office is right next door, so just give a yelp if you need anything at all. If this place yelps anything, it is certainly *"recuperation"*! I can feel myself already recuperating just looking at this.
