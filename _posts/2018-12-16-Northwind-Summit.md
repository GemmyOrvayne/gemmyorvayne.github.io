## Northwind Summit shitter!

Could not believe my luck when I found this little gem â€˜round back of the abandoned-mining-camp-turned-roost-for-Ancient-Dragon, the bones of which you can see in the far background. Incidentally, the Word of Power at this location is part of Aura Whisper. But you know what would be even sweeter? *Shitter Whisper.*

**Khraap.. Bukh.. Ett!**
