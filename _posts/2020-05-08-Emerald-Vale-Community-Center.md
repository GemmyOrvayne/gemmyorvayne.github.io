## Community Center Shitter!

The Emerald Vale Community Center is very fucked. It's supposed to be considered abandoned, yet you can see here there's tons of unclaimed settler bodies, and the surrounding grounds are swarming with Marauders and gross killer insectoids. A quest to find some kind of manual or comic book (maybe a combination of the two) sends you to this location, but as I have demonstrated, the only real reason to come here is Shitter Safari tourism. A bank of toilets with minimal privacy, but dignity is on the back burner at most places in this universe.
