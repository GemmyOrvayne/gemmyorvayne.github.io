## Iconoclast Church shitter!

This is at an unmarked location east of Evergreen Mills. But, we'll call it the First Iconoclast Church of the Badlands shitter. Pretty nice actual throne, a sink, and a partition in tact enough for you to pretend you have some privacy. Of course, raiders seem to just regularly crash here, as evidenced by this team of jackoffs, who rolled up just as I was taking this picture. Check out the human corpse strung up over a burn barrel. We get it guys, you're hardcore. Don't mess with the Church Mice!
