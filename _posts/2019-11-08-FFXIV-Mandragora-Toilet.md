## FFXIV's Mandragora Toilet!

Brought to you by honorary Bucket Brigadier **Ashley**! It is the dawn of a new era, Brigade. The porcelain ceiling is about to be smashed! Ashley's mandragora toilet is a *finalist* in FFXIV's furnishing design contest for 2019. The vision here is exceptional. A mandragora peeping at you when the lid is left up is the perfect reminder. I only hope the leaves on top have a sparkle effect, and hopefully, a flush sound. If this thing wins, FFXIV would finally boast, among the throngs of bookshelves and teapots, the most essential housing furnishing ever. What could be next? Think of the possibilities. Gerolt's Forge shitter. Rowena's Cultural Appropriation shitter. There even could be one for each Primal. A Shitter of Crags! Rngsus bless this designer. Best of luck for a win, Ashley. I want a fleet of these in my Free Company mansion.
